            <h1>biografija</h1>
            <article class="bio">
                <p>Lusteri (Chandeliers, or as our friend once said The Lusters) 
                    is a three-member "acoustic" band from Serbia / Arandjelovac - Belgrade /.</p>
                <p>It was founded as cover band in November 2009.
                    The first line-up consisted of: <br>
                    - Miodrag Antic / guitar and <br>
                    - Marko Stojkovic / guitar, vocals. </p>
                <p>The band successfully performed for two years with more than 300 performances, 
                    performing a repertoire composed of domestic and foreign covers.</p>
                <p>As always we wanted some novelty, so the band joins 
                    Miran Ivanovic / initially only vocals and later also on drums and percussion - tarabuka.</p>
                <p>Miodrag Antic soon leaves the band and remains a duo who still forms the backbone of this band.</p>
                <p>So, since 2011, as a unique acoustic duo, the band has performed in various clubs 
                    / Arandjelovac, Lazarevac, Belgrade, Lajkovac, Bajina Basta, Mladenovac, Smederevska Palanka, Gornji Milanovac, ... /. </p>
                <p>In mid-2017, the band is joined by Aleksandar Jovan Krstic / saxophone, flute, kaval / 
                    what to the band, and adds a new dimension to the repertoire. </p>
                <p>Finally, the composition of the band is:<br>
                    - Miran Ivanovic / vocals, drums, tarabuka <br>
                    - Marko Stojkovic / vocals, guitar <br>
                    - Aleksandar Jovan Krstic / saxophone, flute, kaval, vocals</p>
                <p>What distinguishes this band is the soulfull and raw energy of the performances, 
                    the great musical experience and variety of repertoire 
                    as well as the interesting and unusual treatment of the instruments.
                </p>
                <p>Final but not the last word:</p>
                <p>The beginning of 2018 marked the beginning of the creation of the band's original music 
                    with the hope that soon this segment of this band's music work will see the light of day, 
                    which is proven with first song (Kakav dan) published through CDbaby distribution service.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 'pandemic' 2020. year, more precisely, at 20-th December first album saw 'The light of the day' with name 'Nema kad!'.
                    Album consist 16 songs fo which 9 are songs and 7 are short instrumental works. It was independently released through
                    most of the major digital distribution services (Spotify, Deezer, AppleMusic, YouTubeMusic, Yandex,....)
